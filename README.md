16F690 OneWire and LCD interface
================================

This project integrates a 4x4 keypad, HD44780 type LCD module and Dallas/Maxim OneWire PIO modules, temperature sensors and data logger.

The code is not yet complete and may never be. The project was started as an attempt to help a university student at Universit√© de Lille 1 in France.

The student last check the forum on Monday, May 30, 2016 3:00 so I suspect that the project was not completed and the student has moved on to other educational opportunities.

This project is an example on one way to organize a PIC relocatable assembly language project in a modular way by using multiple source file and the notion of global and local scope for code and data symbols.
